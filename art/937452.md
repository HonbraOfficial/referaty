# A relative story

One day I discovered a programming language that could be used both in the front-end and the back-end.
The people who invented it called it JavaScript.
It has an issue which sometimes makes it hard to understand: weak typing.
Weak typing is a term which means that you could write "5" - 2 and the interpreter wouldn't notice!
People who use languages with strong typing are complaining about this.
The people who invented JavaScript noticed this and added a "use strict" command, which disables weak typing.
People who hated JavaScript for weak typing could now finally sleep in peace.
